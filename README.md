=====================

A simple C++ console program for producing a break point payroll report based on input file records

This program was written for an intro to C++ class that I took. It reads in payroll records and prints as control-break report where the records have been sorted by name and department and payroll totaled by department and also grand-totaled.

The sorting is achieved by storing the records in a binary tree which was coded from scratch.
